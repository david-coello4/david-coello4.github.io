    My name is David Coello. I am a Mexican-American artist who grew up in the Bay Area.
    From illustration, to character designing, and even web creation, I use a variety of softwares, mainly ProCreate as my main drawing program, and using HTML coding to enhance my artworks.
    <br><br>
    Growing up, my creativity was fueled with various elements, from crafting, building, and drawing, I have always been a creative person. In my family, I am considered to be the “artist”, despite being young and not having a ton of artistic quality. The main art medium that stuck with me was drawing. I would always find something like a toy and try to draw it without tracing it. However, something that I would always enjoy using as a reference were video games. Many such as the GameBoy, Nintendo DS, and the Playstation 1 all helped me nourish my creativity as a young kid and it’s what guided me to create my own unique artworks. Even to this day, I revisit some old favorites not just to relive my childhood memories, but to gain inspiration for what artworks I would like to create. 
    <br><br>
    All of these elements are what I love. Sure, some things may be difficult or frustrating as an artist, such as art blocks or codes not working, but that is what makes me grow as an artist. One day in the distant future, once I have much more experience, I plan to create my ultimate project. Making a Video Game.
